## User Story 
* AS A manager
* I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
* SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Usage 
This application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## Instalation 
* This app runs with Inquier NPM(https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer?activeTab=readme)  Because this Challenge will require the use of the Inquirer package with the command: npm i inquirer@8.2.4. This application uses the NPM Jest for running the unit tests. Node(https://nodejs.org/en/). I used the integrated terminal in VSCode to run this serverside app but depending on your operating system, please use your chosen terminal.  

Because this Challenge will require the use of the Inquirer package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: npm i inquirer@8.2.4.
